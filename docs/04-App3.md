# App 3: Adding in a file loader: `observe` and `update`.

We're going to make our file explorer more useful for other files by not hard coding variable names. We'll take a `.csv` file as input, and populate our `selectInput`s with categories that are related to our selected variables.

![*observe/update programming pattern*](img/observe_update.png)

## Exercise

This will be more code review than activity. I apologize. Go through it and you will learn a lot.

1. Open the `app.R` in `03_observe_update`.

2. Try running the following code. What is in `categoricalVars` and what is in `numericVars`? Is it what you expected? If you're confused, please let me know.


```r
#since we're in the shiny_pdx_rlang directory,
#we need to set our working directory to 03_observe_update

library(fivethirtyeight)
library(shiny)
library(tidyverse)

##Load in the helper functions
source("03/_observe_update/helper.R")
data(biopics)
myDataFrame <- biopics

##these functions return the categorical variables and
##the numeric variables, given a data.frame
##They're in helper.R
##Try running all the code before ui
##and look at what categoricalVars and numericVars contains
categoricalVars <- get_category_variables(myDataFrame)
numericVars <- get_numeric_variables(myDataFrame)

glimpse(myDataFrame)
categoricalVars
numericVars
```

3. Try running the app, and try loading the `datasetB.csv` file using the file browser (it should be in `03_observe_update`). Did the `x_variable` and `y_variable` `selectInputs` change?

4. Let's add a `selectInput` to filter on a particular category within our category variable. Uncomment all of the areas that say `uncomment this code for step 4` (there are 4 sections). As you do, follow the path from the `myData()` `reactive` to the `observe` code block to the `selectInput`s in `ui.R`

5. What is going on? Let's start with the `fileInput` in `ui.R`. Where does `input$file1` appear? What do we do with it in the reactive?

6. Now let's look at the `observe` codeblock. Is it dependent on a reactive? Where are we calling the `reactive`? What are we doing in the codeblock?

7. What does the `updateSelectInput` code do? What are we passing into it? What `selectInputs` are we modifying?

8. Try running the app again and make sure that it works before moving on.

## For More Info

There's a few examples of `updateSelectInput`
